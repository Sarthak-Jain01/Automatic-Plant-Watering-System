# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System
An automatic plant watering system using Arduino UNO is a simple project where the plants are watered automatically according to the moisture level detected by the sensor. One of the prominent features of this project is its simplicity and high efficiency. When the water level drops into the soil, the sensor has the lowest resistance which in turn starts the motor to supply water to the plant. As the water level increases in the soil surrounding the plant, the resistance of the sensor increases, in turn switching off the motor i.e., the water supply.

An automatic plant watering system using Arduino UNO circuit design uses six major components â€“ an Arduino, a DC Motor, a resistor, a diode, an NPN transistor and a soil moisture sensor. Here a potentiometer in use to replicate the working of soil moisture sensor. As to reduce all the hardware complexity, we made DC motor based water pump using a diode, transistor and registers combined circuit which operates a DC motor according to the Arduino code. In this system, potentiometer senses the resistance level of the soil to give the accuracy of soil moisture level. If the soil will get dry, then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As the plant gets sufficient water and soil get wet, then sensor senses enough moisture in soil. After which the water pump will automatically get stopped.
