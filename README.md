# Automatic-Plant-Watering-System
An automatic plant watering system using Arduino UNO is a simple project where the plants are watered automatically according to the moisture level detected by the sensor. One of the prominent features of this project is its simplicity and high efficiency. When the water level drops into the soil, the sensor has the lowest resistance which in turn starts the motor to supply water to the plant. As the water level increases in the soil surrounding the plant, the resistance of the sensor increases, in turn switching off the motor i.e., the water supply.
