1. Abstract:
Automatic plant watering system using Arduino Uno is a simple project where the plants are watered automatically according to the moisture level detected by the sensor.
This system uses Soil moisture sensor to sense the moisture level of the soil. One of the prominent features of this project is its simplicity and high efficiency. 
When the water level drops in the soil, the sensor has the lowest resistance which in turn starts the motor to supply water to the plant. 
As the water level increases in the soil surrounding the plant, the resistance of the sensor increases in turn switching off the motor i.e., the water supply. 

2. Motivation:
We want to make our project on something that will be useful in real life.
We all know when the plants are not watered adequately, they tend to die quickly. 
So, there is a requirement for a well-equipped automatic plant watering system. 
We want to utilize the electronic technology to build an integrated and fully customized home plant watering system.

  2.1	 Objective 
    •	Water the plants automatically.
    •	Watering the plants based on the moisture level of the soil.
    •	To give the user a cost effective way of doing so.

3. Target specifications if any: 
Our main object is to utilize the different electronic parts available in the market and build an automatic plant watering system using Arduino, motors etc to give service at low cost. 
We want to make a system that will give 24×7 service by watering plants when required in the house. 
Advantages of Automatic Plant Watering System:~
•	This project ensures that the plants are not harmed due to decrease in water levels.
•	Power consumption is less.
•	Used commonly available components.
•	Project is simple and easy.
Limitations of Automatic Plant Watering System:~
•	It is a low range circuit, i.e. it is not possible to operate the circuit remotely.
•	Once your water storage depletes, you can’t refill if you are not present at home.
